# Sorting Algorithms Project
Preparation of 4 algorithms, with different time complexities, sorting elements of a one-dimensional array without comparing elements.

## Project Description
This project contains implementations of various sorting algorithms and helper functions for manipulating data arrays in the C language. The sorting algorithms include:

- Radix Sort
- Bucket Sort
- Quick Sort
- Counting Sort

Additionally, the project includes functions to:

- Print the array to the screen
- Fill the array with random numbers
- Read the array from a file
- Write the array to a file

The `choice()` function allows the user to choose a sorting method, taking into account the data type (integer vs. floating-point), sorting stability, and the number of elements in the array.
